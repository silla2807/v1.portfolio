              Hello! Back in college, I realized I was very interested in 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> frontend development</span>, but soon enough, I understood my inclination towards both 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> backend and frontend</span> was equal, haha. So here I am, with 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> 10 months of experience</span> as a full-stack developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              My interest in web development started back in college when I worked on a project for my 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> DBMS course</span>. It was a group project, but, well, 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> I took charge</span> and built the website myself! I actually started with 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> HTML and CSS</span> during school. Even though that project wasn‚Äôt hosted anywhere, I consider it a 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> significant milestone</span>‚Äîor more like a stepping stone‚Äîin my journey into web development.
              <br />
              <br />
              Fast forward to my professional life, I joined 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> Magicbricks</span> as a 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> Software Engineer (Full-Stack Developer)</span>. I took some courses, learned on the go, and the experience there gave me a 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> solid foundation</span> in backend technologies like 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> Java and Spring Boot</span>, as well as frontend using 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> React</span>. It was great to learn about 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> Git</span>, write tons of commit messages (some better than others), and contribute to various projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              Now, I am focusing on refining my skills in 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> DSA, OOPs, Java, Spring Boot, System Design, React.js, HTML, CSS,</span> and 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> ES6 JavaScript</span>. I am continuously learning! Recently, I reached the 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> HR round</span> for a frontend role at Walmart and a backend role at Jupiter. I see this as a 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> sign of progress</span>, and I‚Äôm working hard to clear all remaining hurdles to land a great job.
              <br />
              <br />
              I‚Äôm eager to work, solve 
              <span className="font-bold text-blue-400"> challenging problems</span>, and tackle new opportunities. Looking forward to what‚Äôs next! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
